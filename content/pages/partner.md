Cutting the cost without having to sacrifice the quality, finding the partner that understands your needs and can actually contribute to the problem-solving process or how about trying to beat competition and come up with the best proposition for potential clients – as you can see a lot of effort goes into pairing the right client and project with the right vendor.

Just like there’s no such thing as a universal client, there’s no one way of collaborating. Choosing the appropriate client engagement model for software development is the primary task aimed to align goals around a common outcome and the best suitable pricing model. The decision to choose this or that engagement model can be based on various factors that might be objective like the maturity level of vendor and their track record of success, or subjective like customer’s previous experiences with other service providers.


## Dedicated Team
A project engagement model with a dedicated team means an extension of the client’s team with the offshore, nearshore, or onshore vendors’ specialists, while the other project members are retained on the client’s side. The specialists your firm is supplemented with are supposed to entirely comply with the existing corporate culture, rules, and the best practices of your company. Moreover, this new team takes over your company’s technical resources, tools, and methodologies, and should be expected to recognize themselves as an important part of the organization.

Being the simplest approach to outsourcing engagement, it will work well for a long-standing relationship and long-term projects, although it requires vast managerial experience and extensive technology background, largely, on the part of the client’s team. The supplier normally takes a big deal of responsibility above the dedicated team performance with due consideration to motivation aspect. Working out reward programs, making a positive work environment, encouraging personal advancement and other similar initiatives will definitely increase the project performance rate.

Choose Dedicated Team Engagement Model when:

* When you need more manpower for the in-house development team
* When you are fond of cross-border knowledge sharing and bringing in outside minds
* When you have a fair vision of how your project should evolve and have enough time and resources to keep abreast of all the management aspects


## Fixed Price
Fixing the price is about fixing the scope, project requirements, as well as deadlines. This model will never work without thorough initial planning, estimation, and analysis sessions. The more planning you do, the better the outcome

Why is the planning stage so important? The success of the fixed price project is directly proportional to the success of this initial phase. The slightest change in the scope can turn into endless negotiations between the parties with a negative impact on a product’s time-to-market. The main benefit of selecting this particular engagement model is predefined and fixed project’s budget, which means you know exactly how much you are going to spend on your product, but the cost may vary widely because of the smallest changes in the scope.

Choose Fixed Price Engagement Model when:

* Requirements are clear, well defined and unlikely to change
* You deal with small or medium project which won’t last for more than few months
* You used to outsource similar projects before

## Consulting
A cost-effective model where the amount of money you spend corresponds to the amount of work delivered. The client and the vendor usually agree upon an hourly, daily or weekly rate for the allocated project resources. This engagement model is often preferred because it offers flexibility to change requirements on the fly, ability to balance project resources, and spread the workload.

Choose Time & Material Engagement Model when:

* You have constantly evolving or unclear requirements
* It’s a large project with numerous iterations planned
* Your developments needs will deviate over the time
* You appreciate transparency in customer-vendor relationships
