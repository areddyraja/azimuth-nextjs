title: Culture defines the company
subtitle: >-
  Culture is the one thing what makes the difference between success and failure, yours and ours. We believe success is an externally perceived bounded metric, while satisfaction is internal and is unbounded. If we are not satisfied, success is immaterial. This is something we identify strongly with Akrantha.
