### Reorganize for faster product delivery
Traditionally, new software release meant shutting down business operations at least for few hours. Today businesses are constantly trying to innovate and differentiate themselves. For this, they want to deploy newest version of their service to their users frequently, that too without disrupting their 24/7 availability.

This upsurge in deployment frequency led to the rise of ‘Zero Downtime Deployment’, where all the services are available and running without any downtime during a release. This demands end-to-end automation to reduce risk and support rapidly changing business process needs.
